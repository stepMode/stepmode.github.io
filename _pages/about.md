Last but not least I would like to tell you about [The Penetration Testing Community<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>](https://discord.gg/sNsCSqZ){:target="_blank"}.
As the name may gave away, it's a Discord community with a focus on Penetration Testing and related topics. We are happy to welcome people of any skill level and background. But we require a certain amount of **mature / professional** behaviour and don't accept illegal activities.
